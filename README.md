For the first task of my CodTech internship, I developed a project titled "Weather Data Visualization Using WeatherAPI and Python". The primary objective of this task was to fetch real-time weather data from a public API and convert it into a visual format using Python, helping to transform raw data into meaningful insights. This project focused on two key areas: API integration and data visualization. Initially, I attempted to use OpenWeatherMap, a popular weather API, but encountered authentication errors due to limitations with the free API key. As a solution, I switched to WeatherAPI, which provided free and reliable access to weather data. Using Python’s requests library, I sent a GET request to the WeatherAPI forecast endpoint, requesting data for a specified city and number of forecast days. The response came in JSON format, which I parsed to extract essential details like the date and average temperature for each forecasted day.

After successfully retrieving the weather data, I focused on visualizing the information using Matplotlib, one of Python’s most popular plotting libraries. I extracted the relevant dates and corresponding temperature values and stored them in separate lists. These were then used to create a line graph, with dates on the X-axis and average temperatures on the Y-axis. To make the graph more readable and informative, I included axis labels, a chart title, and grid lines. The visualization helped illustrate temperature fluctuations over a 7-day period in a clear and easy-to-understand format. I also implemented basic error handling in the script to manage cases such as missing data or invalid API keys. The final script allowed the user to input a city name and get a visual dashboard of the upcoming week’s temperature trends, making it useful for planning or analysis.

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with real-world API usage and improve my skills in data extraction, processing, and visualization. I learned how to communicate with RESTful APIs, manage API keys securely, parse JSON responses, and transform raw data into insightful visual outputs. I also understood the importance of visualizing time-series data, especially when trying to communicate patterns or trends effectively. Overall, this task served as a solid foundation for the upcoming internship tasks and gave me a clear understanding of how different components — like API calls and data plotting — can come together in a single functional program. It was a rewarding experience that reinforced both my technical knowledge and my ability to build practical, user-focused solutions.
